## Project Overview

In this project, I delved into a dataset extracted from the **AdventureWorksDW2019** database. The dataset, which captures internet sales, was curated using an SSIS package to process an ETL where multiple dimension tables were joined with a primary fact table.

A Power BI report was then designed to visualize the insights from this dataset. This report included KPI controllers, slicers for region-based filtering, and a variety of charts such as area charts for yearly sales, bar charts for sales by color and subcategory, and a comparative analysis of unit cost vs. price.

## Key Insights

1. **Yearly Sales Dynamics**:
   - The dataset unveils a significant growth trajectory in sales, culminating in a peak in 2013. This might suggest a successful marketing campaign, product launch, or expansion in that year.
   - The dramatic downturn in 2014 warrants further investigation. It could be indicative of market saturation, increased competition, or perhaps a change in product quality or marketing strategy.

2. **Product Profitability**:
   - While Bikes, especially Road Bikes, lead in terms of sales, the markup on Accessories highlights a lucrative profit margin. This suggests that while Bikes might be the flagship product, Accessories provide a stealthy boost to profitability.
   - The considerable markup on Accessories, especially when compared to their low unit cost, implies that promoting accessories could amplify profit margins further.

3. **Customer Preferences and Behavior**:
   - The preference for Black and Red products might be rooted in popular culture trends, seasonality, or specific product campaigns. It provides an opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns focusing on these colors.
   - The dominance of Road Bikes and Mountain Bikes in sales suggests a market inclined towards fitness and outdoor activities. Tailoring marketing strategies towards health benefits and adventure could resonate well with the target audience.

4. **Cost Implications**:
   - The surge in average unit cost in June is intriguing. It might be due to the introduction of a premium product line, increased manufacturing costs, or perhaps a shift towards selling more high-end products during this period.

5. **Strategic Opportunities**:
   - The data provides a compelling case for potential bundling strategies, where Bikes and Accessories are sold as packages, leveraging the high profit margins of Accessories.
   - Identifying the root causes of the 2014 sales dip could provide insights into areas of improvement and potential market gaps.
